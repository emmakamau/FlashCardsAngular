Flash Card
You have learnt a lot since you start this journey of becoming a Programmer.  Wouldn't it be really cool if you could have somewhere to record all the new programming vocabularies (and their explanations) that you have encountered?

Once you finish creating the to-do list project above and feel comfortable about the concepts you learnt so far, you can challenge yourself further and create a flashcard app. A flashcard app is a site where you create cards that contain new words you learnt and their explanations.

Follow along with the lessons you've covered so far and add functionality similar to the Goals app with the following user stories as your guide:

As a user, I would like to see the title of each flash card
as a user, I want to be able to click on the card's title to see it's explanation/detail.
As a user, I want to be able to hide a card detail when am done viewing them.
